# Scientific-Calculator

#### Project realized in half a day after three days learning Python at the Coding Academy by Epitech.

We were asked to create a scientific calculator in Python. I decided to add the import tkinter to manage the display of the calculator.

To display the Scientific Calculator, you have to install python3 and tkinter for python3.
